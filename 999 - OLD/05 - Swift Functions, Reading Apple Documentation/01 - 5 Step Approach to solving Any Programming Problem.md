1. Google
2. Stack Overflow
3. Implement
4. API Docs
5. Customize

## 1. Googling:
- your `optimal` search should be in the syntax:
```google
<Your problem> + <Tech Stack> + <Where exactly>
eg: How to play sound swift stackoverflow
```

## 2. Stack Overflow
- look at not just the top answer but the top three

## 3. Implement:
- copypasta-ish (make it work) in your own project

## 4. API Docs:
- go to apple docs to see what the thing you copypasta-ed actually does
- ==alternatively, if you `option + click` on anything that comes from the Apple API, it will show you a quick documentation about that thing==

## 5. Customize:
- after understanding what the code does, you adapt it to your own codebase
