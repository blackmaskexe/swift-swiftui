- for setting content constrained to percentages rather than hardcoded pixel values

NOTE: You can also constrain one element in relation to the other element, as well as have alignment for it at the same time (so for example horizontally align but stay 30 pixels below this element)

NOTE: You can specify the size of an element to be constant throughout all these constraints and alignments
