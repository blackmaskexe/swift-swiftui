- used when you want to position elements to be set a particular pixel distance away from each of the edges
- useful for setting backgrounds, etc
- mostly for elements in which you don't care about their alignment
- if you do care about their alignment, visit the next page
## Steps to set Constraints:
#### 1. Choose a preferred device, make the elements look as intended on that particular device

#### 2. Click on the "Add New Constraint" button:

#### 3. Make sure the constraints are activated:![[Udemy ScreenShot 2025-07-10 14-53-06.jpeg]]
- make the dotted lines into active red lines
#### 4. If you want the element to cover the entire screen, and not leave space for the safe area, select the following option:

- set the Second Item option to Superview
- this option is helpful especially for covering the entire area with a set background

#### 5. Set relativity (relative to margin or default):
- within the "Trailing Alignment Constraint" menu that pops up when clicking on a constraint (see above screenshot, the menu on the right), can you click "Relative to margin", which will make the elements aligned relative to the margin (the area that appear when dragging elements which is slightly inside the screen and not on the edges)
