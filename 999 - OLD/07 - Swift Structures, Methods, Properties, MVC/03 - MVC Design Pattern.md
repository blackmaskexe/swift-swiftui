## Design Pattern:
- a proven solution to a common problem
- our problem is complexity stuffed in the same file
- the solution is to split functionality

## Model:
- parts of code that handle Data and Logic

## View:
- user interfaces

## Controller:
- mediator between ui and model
- view sends request to controller, which is sent to model, and the model sends data back to controller which is then sent to the view
