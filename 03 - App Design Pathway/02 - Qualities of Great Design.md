## 1. Good Quality:
- things that aren't painful to use, all the things that the user needs is laid out conveniently
- feels like it's "easier to get things done in this design"
- design should be "obvious"
- concentration towards 'task at hand'

## 2. Good for not just you but the target audience:
- intentions are felt 
- "give a shet"


## 3. Where:
-  every fascet of the product upholds quality (every area of your app)
- from app store screenshots, to icon, to in-app design

## 4. Design Quality Aspirations:
1. Simple
	- a good app does exactly what it should, not more, not less
	- familiar gestures and navigation
	- you don't want people to feel distracted
	- just do one thing really well
2. Stunning
	- 
3. Timeless
4. Leave a positive impact
	- 

## 5. Teaching the Rules:
- don't give them too much at the beginning, while keeping them curious

## 6. Techniques:
- prototype a lot (to create a concept before starting to design) -> you can't assume and straight away code
- be patient, let the creativity come in naturally and not to rush things
- be open to feedback instead of being defensive (it's understandable, but don't, understand their feedback) + get fresh eyes on something you might have developed blind spots while working on your project for a long time
- keep in mind the way you do things is not the same as how the customers will do things
