### In order to create references to objects that you create in interface builder:
1. Open both the storyboard main preview screen, and the code screen side by side (use Assistant view feature thing)
2. press control on the element, drag it onto the code section
3. it will automatically prompt you to connect the two things together (connect code with interface builder)

## Programmatically changing the properties of linked elements
- you can look at the names of the properties of the element in the Attributes tab (on the right side of the screen in the above image)
- Can tap into the property of the linked element like follow: (changing the image associated with an image view component)
```swift
import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {
// IB stands for Interface Builder, IBOUtlet connects storyboard (interface builder) to code
    @IBOutlet weak var diceImageView1: UIImageView!
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
        diceImageView1.image = UIImage(imageLiteralResourceName: "DiceThree");
        // DiceThree is an image that is located in the Assets folder
    }
}

// Note that the diceImageView1 was generated by tghe use of linking storyboard with code
```
