## Naming Convention:
- camelCase

## Comments:
```swift
// bro this is a comment in swift
var type = "shi";
```
- to comment a line, you can do `Command + /`
- multiline comments:
```swift
/*
I don't hang with rats, that's a new typeshi
*/
```
## Strings:
- convention is to use double quotes `"String"`
- strings can be printed using `print(String)`

## Xcode Playground:
`File -> New -> Playground -> blank iOS template`
- contains code editor, interpreter, debug area
- this is a playground for testing out swift code

## Swift Print:

#### 1. String Interpolation
```swift
print("Hello \(2+3) World")

// the above will output Hello 5 World
// this is like a string literal from javascript, just uses \(expression) instead of ${expression}
```
