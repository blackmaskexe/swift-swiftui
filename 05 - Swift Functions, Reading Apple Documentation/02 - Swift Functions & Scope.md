## Creating a Function:
```swift
func functionName () {
	// code block
}
```
- creating nested functions are possible, but they are then block-scoped
## Calling / Executing a Function:
```swift
functionName()
```

## Scope:
- defines where the function / variables can be used
- swift is a block-scoped language like javascript
- ==TIP: In order to indent your code, you can do: `Command + A (select everything) -> Editor -> structure -> re-indent`==![[annotely_image (5).png]]
