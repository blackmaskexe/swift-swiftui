- Anything declared in the outermost block of a file becomes the global scope
- Example:
	- A variable declared in the global scope of any file can be accessed in any other file just using it's name, no imports needed or anything like that

- These variables are instantiated only once, so load once and stay in the stack (or whatever it's called)
